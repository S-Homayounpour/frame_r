#' frame: Fire Research and Modelling Environment
#' 
#' This package provides an interface to the Forest Flammability Model of
#' Zylstra et al, adding functions for complex fire simulation and first-order 
#' fire effects modelling. It provides  the primary functions required to prepare input 
#' parameters, run model simulations, and query the output database of model results,
#' as well as introducing complex simulations. First-order effects models are provided
#' for plant canopies, stems, and soil effects.
#' 
#' The package includes a distribution of the model and its dependencies in the
#' form of Java jar files. The only additional requirement is an installation
#' of Java version 1.8 (aka Java 8) or higher on the host system.
