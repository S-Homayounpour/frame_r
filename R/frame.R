#' Zylstra et al. It provides functions to prepare input parameters, run model
#' simulations, and query the output database of model results. The package
#' includes a distribution of the model and its dependencies in the
#' form of Java jar files. The only additional requirement is an installation
#' of Java version 1.8 (aka Java 8) or higher on the host system.
