Description: This package provides an interface to the forest flammability 
    model of Zylstra et al. It provides functions to prepare input parameters,
    run model simulations, and query the output database of model results. The
    package includes a distribution of the model and its dependencies in the
    form of Java jar files. The only additional requirement is an installation
    of Scala (the Java-related language in which the model is programmed) on
    the host system. See the introduction to the rscala package (used by this
    package) for details on installing Scala.
