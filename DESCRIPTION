Description: This package allows the forest flammability model to be run from
    within R. It provides functions to prepare input parameters, run model
    simulations, and query the output database of model results. The package
    includes a distribution of the model and its dependencies in the form of
    Java jar files. The only additional requirement is an installation of
    Scala (the Java-related language in which the model is programmed) on the
    host system. See the introduction to the rscala package (used by this 
    package) for details on installing Scala.
